# Sprint Challenge: Sprint 1

## Objectives

- Student can articulate breaking down a release into individual tasks.
- Student can accurately defend scope or timeline of an individual task
- Students will be able to articulate tradeoffs for architectural and design decisions

## Prompt 1 - Communicating Process

Hiring managers don't just want to see what you built, they want to see the reasoning behind it. Here are some questions surveyed hiring managers said they would ask about a project:

- "How did you decide what to build?"
- "Why is this feature important?"
- "Was this a good choice? What would you do differently if you had to do it over again?"

We took these questions and cooked them into your labs experience. Please answer the following questions as you would in an interview. Remember, hiring managers care about the **process** and the **why** of building something even more than the what.

### Questions you need to answer

1. Describe your **process** of breaking a release into user stories.
When planning for what user stories to use for the app/website, I break it down into the most important aspects of what the release needs. I'll guide myself with what the project's stakeholder required us to use, what the project is about (this is extremely crucial in order to conclude which technologies to use, and other helpful resources for the project), and from there ask my questions related to the project that haven't been answered and could be crucial to the project as a whole. Then from there, conclude which user stories I have in mind, speak to my team about what their thoughts about them are, and then when we all approve it I will start dissecting it into steps on how we're going to approach those user stories and how we will solve it.
2. Choose a user story. Describe your **reasoning** as you broke down that particular user story into individual tasks.
One of the most crucial parts of the DS portion of the project is the automated complexity score that gives out the results to students on what their writing level is, how easy it is to comprehend, if the grammar is properly utilized, etc. The stakeholder themselves mentioned in the first meeting how important it is to the project, so the immediately I researched different approaches we could use to create or use a NLP (natural language processing) model that will output a complexity score to the student (in this case, they are the users. The parents are the customers). After I made my research, I found the most appropriate and useful NLP model that we can use for this score and how we're going to implement it. Then, I met up with my DS partner to see what he thought about it and we concluded that it was the best one to use. I instructed him step by step on how to use it, gave him the necessary links related to the NLP model, and started testing it to see if the functionality was as expected. Finally, we made the ultimate decision that we're going to use that model and notify the rest of the team about our decision.
3. How long do you think the above user story will take to complete? Explain your reasoning.
Well, since it already has been completed I will give the exact details on that. We took approximately an hour testing out this NLP model and concluding how useful it is. The best part about it was how quickly it was to find, and how this NLP model was perfect for this specific user story. So the beginning portion of it didn't take long at all since I already had in mind what we will be using and how to find it. All in all, this process took us about two hours in total to break it down and make our final verdict.

## Prompt 2 - Communicating Technical Decisions

On the job, you'll be making technical decisions every day. Hiring managers want to see how you make a choice and how you communicate your decisions. Here are some examples of questions they might ask about one of your projects in an interview:

- "What kind of database did you choose and why?"
- "Why did you use X to do Y?"

These sorts of questions inform your entire labs experience. You made a few technical decisions this week. We want to see how you would communicate them in an interview.

### Questions you need to answer

1. Describe a technical decision you made. How did you make that decision?
One crucial technical decision was what ML (machine learning) model we will use for the automated content moderation. This wasn’t necessarily brought up by the stakeholders, but we suggested it (this was also one of the questions I had for them) and they thought it was a practical idea to use for the project. We then researched what ML model we will be using, and once we found it we read through the documentation on how it works and how implement it. Finally, we concluded that this was perfect especially since it had different age ranks for moderation. 
2. What are some of the risks given the decision you made?
A risk I could see happening could be the usage of abbreviations of foul language. But before any of that happens, we will make sure to train the ML model as much as possible so it will still raise a flag on those inappropriate abbreviations and it will be sent to the human moderator for review.
3. What challenges do you foresee in using the architecture your team selected?
To be sincere, the architecture we selected is very solid. We organized it very thoroughly and we spent a valuable amount of time making sure that everything was in order and that we had all necessary components for the project . I feel as of right now, there shouldn’t be any problems that will be presented in the near future.

## Prompt 3 - Professional Development 

### [Power Statements](https://learn.lambdaschool.com/cr/module/recQUR9bWxvLBJknr](https://learn.lambdaschool.com/cr/module/recQUR9bWxvLBJknr))

This lesson we reinforced how to turn your responsibilities and tasks into power statements. To practice, write a few power statements you intend to use in your LinkedIn profile. Before writing those statements, ensure your LinkedIn has all the following content checked off.

Add a link to your Linkedin in your sprint challenge submission document.

## Personal and Contact Information:

- [x]  First and last name are added to profile
- [x]  Created a [shortened, unique](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/87/customizing-your-public-profile-url?lang=en) LinkedIn URL
- [x]  Profile picture is clear, shows my face (not a selfie), and is in front of a professional background
- [x]  Listed title, `i.e. iOS Developer`, below name with any keyword associations included.  **For example: “Data Scientist, with a passion for data visualizations and open-source code”**
    - [x]  Title **does not** pull from my current position (this is a LinkedIn default, must manually change), unless that position is relevant to the tech industry

## About Section

    - [x]  Power statements for each experience [are bulleted](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/update-how-add-bullet-points-your-linkedin-profile-erin-dore-miller/), not in paragraph form.
    - [x]  Listed responsibilities in bullet point format (I **did not** leave in paragraph format). If you use Windows, hold down the ALT key and type 0149 on the keypad. Release the ALT key and the bullet point will appear. On a Mac, press Opt + 8 on the keyboard.
    - [x]  Started each bullet point with [an action verb](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZkDPBWtQZDGGdvStD61iRx_jOWVlIyyQl9UOYHtZgA/edit?usp=sharing) and **did not** re-use phrases such as:  `Assisted with...` `Worked on...` `Helped with...`  (`Solely responsible for...`)
    - [x]  Described past projects in past tense and current projects in present tense
    - [x]  Did not use pronouns such as: I, we, they, you, me, us

## Education

- [x]  Listed all education and relevant certifications: including name of the institution, degree type, and date the degree was received or will be received `i.e. May 2020` or `Expected July 2025`
    - [x]  I **did** link to Lambda School properly (Lambda logo saved)

## Skills

- [x]  **Listed** all technical skills, methodologies, and platforms with strongest skills [pinned at the top of the list](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/35265/display-order-of-skill-endorsements?lang=en)

With all the above checked off, go to LinkedIn's "Accomplishments" section to add a project. Articulating the tasks or project work you're doing publicly on a platform like LinkedIn can help you gain visibility! LinkedIn is designed to produce better results, recommendations, and engagement for users who have thorough profiles and who upload content. If you haven't done so already, write a few power statements as well as a project description to populate those content fields and describe your project on LinkedIn.

This is also a good time to add your fellow labs teammates as connections so that you can add them as "creators" on the project.
