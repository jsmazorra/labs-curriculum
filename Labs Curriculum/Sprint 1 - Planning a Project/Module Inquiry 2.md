# Module Inquiry 2

## Questions

1. What technical choices did you make today?
- Implemented the NLP model for the complexity score and got it working successfully. 
- Worked on setting up the automated moderation control with Moderate Content.
- Worked on setting the complexity score NLP model unto our FastAPI.
2. Pick two technical choices you're happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against?
    - Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.
    - Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.
    - > Finding the right NLP model to get the complexity score was definitely the peak of the day. Finding the appropriate module was extremely convenient and it works tremendously for the project we're working on. It's definitely a useful model we're going to be working until the end of the project and I would like to use it for future projects. I also analyzed how the module worked by checking out their Github repo, and they've done a fantastic job.
    - > Working on the automated moderation control was straightforward with no blockers that presented along the way. The API documentation page really details down the most important aspects and how to use them in a successful manner, so not much time was spent on this task.
    - > For the disadvantage I will say it was spending too much time on reading the documentation for hosting on AWS BeanStalk and how to set it up. I feel it's best to focus on one task, and not move on unto the next task until the other one has been exceptionally completed.
3. In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did.
- I ultimately decided to focus more on the complexity score NLP model. At the end, the most important objective of DS is to provide the complexity scores for students. Yes, the automated moderation is crucial but the complexity score is the one we're going to be using more frequently throughout this project.
4. Extracting useful conclusions from your process: 
    - According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?
    -> A good technical choice would be one that would be the most useful for the project being worked on. Focus on breaking through the most important tasks, and then work on whatever add-ons and improvements that'll be useful for the app/website. Also, getting the necessary help along the way to complete those main tasks will be extremely important. At the end of the day, we're working as a team and communication is key in this process.
